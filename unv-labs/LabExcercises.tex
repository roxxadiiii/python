	\item write a python functions that counts the numbers of words in a string.
	\item write a python functions that counts the numbers of lines in a given string.
	\item write a python functions that prints the numbers of digits and punctuations marks that appear in a string.
	\item write a python program to reverse a given string without using slicing.
	
\section{Lists:}

	\item write a python program to remove all duplicates from a given list.
	\item write a python functions FindMaxMin that returns the maximum values in a list.
\section{Dictonaries:}

	\item write a python function that takes a dictonary as input and returns the key with the highest value.
\section{Functions and Arguments:}
	\item Write a python function isPrime that checks if a number is prime number.
	\item write a python function that accepts an arbitrary number of keyword arguments and prints the result as a dictonary.
	\item write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the square of all those numbers.
	\item write a function that takes the radius of a circle and returns the diameter,area,and circumference of it.
	\item write a function that takes a number as input and tells if it is divisible by 3 or not,without dividing it.
	\item write a function that takes a number as input and tells if it is divisible by 11 or not,without dividing it.
\section{List Comprehensions:}
	\item write a python program that takes a list of integers and return a new list that contains only the even numbers using list comprehensions.
	\item write a python list comprehension to generate a list of squares of number between 1 and 10.

\section{File Handeling:}
	\item Write a python program to read a text file and print the numbers of lines,words,and characters in it.
	\item write a python program to write the contents of one file into another file.
	\item write a program that finds a given string in a given file.
	\item write a program that finds a given string in a file and returns the place where the string appears in the file.your prorgram should return the index of the first character of the given string in the file.
	\item write a python program that finds a given word in a file and replaces all the instances of the given word with another given word(similiar to find and replace all functionality).
	
\section{Exception Handling:}
	\item Write a python program that handles the ZeroDivisionError exception.
	\item write a python function that raises a ValueError if a non-numeric values is passed as an argument
	
\section{Classes and Objects:}
	\item Write a Python class Rectangle that has attributes for length and has attributes for length and width and methods to calculate the area and perimeter.
	\item Write a python class BankAccount with methods to deposit,withdraw,and check the balance of the account.
	\item Write a Python class with a method that behaves differently based on the number of arguments passed (simulate method overloading).
	
	\item Implement a class with an add method that can add two or three numbers using method overloading techniques .
	
	\item Create a method that performs different operations based on argument types (e.g. Multiply if both are ints , repeat if first is string and second is int).
